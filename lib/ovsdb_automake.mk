# This must be done late: macros in targets are expanded when the
# target line is read, so if this file were to be included before some
# other file that added to OVSIDL_BUILT, then those files wouldn't get
# the dependency.
#
# However, current versions of Automake seem to output all variable
# assignments before any targets, so it doesn't seem to be a problem,
# at least for now.
