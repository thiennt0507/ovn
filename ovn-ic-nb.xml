<database name="ovn-ic-nb" title="OVN Interconnection Northbound Database">
  <p>
    This database is the interface for cloud management system (CMS), such as
    OpenStack, to configure OVN interconnection settings.  The CMS produces
    almost all of the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-ic</code>
    program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into
    the <ref db="OVN_IC_Southbound"/> database.
  </p>

  <p>
    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of OVN interconnection.
  </p>

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

  <p>
    Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
    <code>external_ids</code>.  This column has the same form and purpose each
    place it appears.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>external_ids</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      Key-value pairs for use by the CMS.  The CMS might use certain pairs, for
      example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to
      those in this database.

      on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed
      by the CA certificate thus obtained.  <em>This option exposes the
